## Data Analysis
In today's competitive job market, retaining the best staff is critical to success. I'm thrilled to share some insightful observations I made while used the potent data analysis tool Power BI to examine HR data. Overall Attrition Rate: research I conducted found an employee turnover rate of 16.12%. This indicates that out of a total of 1470 employees, 237 left the organization. This provides us with a good starting point, but for more context, it's crucial to compare it to industry benchmarks.
